# @acahet/playwright-reporter

A self-hosted Playwright test history dashboard — no SaaS, no subscriptions, no external services. A custom reporter writes a local JSON index after every run, and a single-file HTML dashboard reads it directly from disk.

In this workspace, the package source is located at `packages/playwright-reporter`.

## Install

```bash
npm install -D @acahet/playwright-reporter
```

## Quick start

### 1. Configure (optional but recommended)

Create one of these in your project root:

- `pw-dashboard.config.js`
- `pw-dashboard.config.cjs` (recommended if your project uses `"type": "module"`)
- `pw-dashboard.config.mjs`
- `pw_dashboard.config.js` (legacy underscore alias)

> `pw-dashboard.config.ts` and `pw_dashboard.config.ts` are not supported for `pw-history-init`.

```js
// pw-dashboard.config.js
module.exports = {
	projectName: 'Acme E2E', // shown in topbar and footer
	brandName: 'pw_dashboard', // top-left brand label
	pageTitle: 'Acme Test Dashboard', // browser tab title
	historyDir: 'dashboard/test-history', // must match playwright.config.ts
	maxRuns: 30, // optional, default is 30
};
```

A starter config file is included in the package at `pw-dashboard.config.js`.

> You can also keep all settings in `playwright.config.*` reporter options (one place):
>
> ```ts
> reporter: [
>   ['html'],
>   ['@acahet/playwright-reporter/reporter', {
>     historyDir: 'dashboard/test-history',
>     projectName: 'Acme E2E',
>     brandName: 'Acme Dashboard',
>     pageTitle: 'Acme Test Dashboard',
>   }],
> ],
> ```
>
> Then `npx pw-history-init` will infer these values as fallback if no `pw-dashboard.config.*` exists.
>
### 2. Generate the dashboard

```bash
npx pw-history-init
```

Or when using a config path outside standard names:

```bash
npx pw-history-init --playwright-config=playwright.config.ts --dashboard-config=pw-dashboard.config.js
```

Reads your config file, injects your settings, and writes `index.html` into `historyDir`. Re-run after upgrading the package to pick up dashboard updates; your config is always preserved.

### 3. Register the reporter in `playwright.config.ts`

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
	reporter: [
		['html'],
		[
			'@acahet/playwright-reporter/reporter',
			{
				historyDir: 'dashboard/test-history', // must match pw-dashboard.config.*
				projectName: 'PW-UI-API',
				brandName: 'ACAHET DASHBOARD',
				pageTitle: 'Reporter',
				maxRuns: 30, // optional, default is 30
			},
		],
	],
	use: {
		trace: 'on-first-retry',
		screenshot: 'on', // required for the gallery page
	},
});
```

Important: `pw-history-init` uses `pw-dashboard.config.*` to generate `index.html`. In addition, if you don’t have a dashboard config file, `pw-history-init` now falls back to reporter options found in `playwright.config.*` (projectName, brandName, pageTitle, historyDir). Keep `historyDir` identical between settings to avoid stale data.

> Note: `pw-history-init` only builds the dashboard UI. You must run `npx playwright test` to produce test run data (`history-index.json` + `runs/<run-id>`) that the dashboard visualizes.
>
> This README is included in the published npm package (`node_modules/@acahet/playwright-reporter/README.md`), so consumers can read this flow in installation docs.

### 4. Run tests and serve the dashboard

```bash
npx playwright test
# Install serve if missing:
# npm install -D serve
# or npm install -g serve
# then point to your configured historyDir:
# npx serve dashboard/test-history
# or npx serve tests/report/test-history
npx serve <your historyDir>
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` — the dashboard always shows the latest run.

> ⚠️ If your dashboard appears stale, re-run `npx pw-history-init` and confirm your `historyDir` is the same in both `pw-dashboard.config.*` and `playwright.config.*`.

## Features

### Reporter

- Records every test run to `history-index.json`
- Captures pass, fail, flaky, skipped counts and total duration per run
- Stores per-test: title, file, project, duration, status, error message, tags, and Playwright annotations
- Detects flaky tests automatically — passed on retry after a prior failure
- Copies failure artifacts (trace + screenshot) into a per-run directory scoped to the specific failing test
- Retains the last **N runs** (default 30) as the single retention policy — index and disk stay in sync
- Orphan guard removes any run directories not referenced in the index
- Error boundary in `onEnd` — reporter failures never affect test exit codes
- Skips `setup` project tests
- Requires Playwright ≥ 1.42

### Dashboard pages

**Dashboard**

- Suite health grade (A–F) on the latest run: 60% pass rate, 30% stability, 10% performance
- Latest run stat cards: pass rate, passed, failed, flaky, skipped, total, duration
- Clicking passed / failed / flaky / skipped filters that run's test list instantly
- Stacked bar chart across last 30 runs with hover tooltip
- Run duration line chart
- Per-test view: search by name, project, or tag; sparkline of last 10 runs per card

**Test detail** (click any test card)

- Full run history with date, runId, status, duration
- Duration-over-time mini chart with min / avg / max and `±% vs prev` delta
- Failure reason grouping — normalises error messages to surface recurring patterns
- Annotation support: `title` shown before the error, `description` in the header
- Playwright error collapsed by default, expandable on click

**Trends**

- 4 charts across last 30 runs: Pass rate, Duration, Flaky count, Slow count
- Each panel shows current value, delta vs previous run, and min / avg / max

**Gallery**

- Grid of failure screenshots grouped by run
- Lightbox on click, Escape to close

**Sidebar**

- Navigate: Dashboard, Trends, Search tests, Gallery
- Tag and Spec filter chips auto-populated from your test data
- Recent runs list — click any run to scroll and auto-expand it

**Run cards**

- Collapsed by default, showing failed + flaky only
- `SLOW` badge on tests above 1.5× the P75 duration of that run
- Errors collapsed inline, expandable per test
- Artifact links: download trace or screenshot per test

## Options

| Option        | Type     | Default                         | Description                                             |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `projectName` | `string` | `''`                            | Label shown in topbar/footer                            |
| `brandName`   | `string` | `'pw_dashboard'`               | Brand label shown in top-left                           |
| `pageTitle`   | `string` | `'Test History Dashboard'`      | Browser tab title                                      |
| `historyDir`  | `string` | `'./tests/report/test-history'` | Where to write/read dashboard files and run history     |
| `maxRuns`     | `number` | `30`                            | How many runs to keep in the index and on disk          |

Notes:

- `projectName`, `brandName`, and `pageTitle` are applied to `index.html` by `npx pw-history-init`.
- `historyDir` and `maxRuns` should be set in both `pw-dashboard.config.*` and reporter options for consistent behavior.

---

## Troubleshooting

- `history-index.json` is missing: run `npx playwright test` at least once. `npx pw-history-init` only generates `index.html`.
- Config ignored in module projects: use `pw-dashboard.config.cjs` instead of `.js` with `module.exports`.
- Values not updated in `index.html`: re-run `npx pw-history-init` after upgrading the package.
- Dashboard loads but shows no data: ensure `historyDir` is exactly the same in both config files.

---

## Using annotations

```ts
test('checkout fails with expired card', async ({ page }) => {
	test.info().annotations.push(
		{ type: 'title', description: 'Known payment gateway timeout' },
		{
			type: 'description',
			description: 'Card validation times out after 30s under load',
		},
	);
	// test body
});
```

The `title` annotation appears as a prominent label before the Playwright error in run history. The `description` appears in the test detail header. Any other annotation types appear as chips under the test name.

## Using with Azure App Testing

Create a thin wrapper config — your reporter and test code stay untouched:

```ts
// playwright.service.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
import { getServiceConfig } from '@azure/microsoft-playwright-testing';
import baseConfig from './playwright.config';

export default defineConfig(baseConfig, getServiceConfig(baseConfig), {
	reporter: [
		['list'],
		['@azure/microsoft-playwright-testing/reporter'],
		['@acahet/playwright-reporter'],
	],
});
```

Run with Azure: `npx playwright test --config=playwright.service.config.ts`

To detach: delete the service config, remove the package. Zero changes to tests.

## File structure after setup

```
your-project/
└── <historyDir>/
	├── index.html              ← generated by pw-history-init
	├── history-index.json      ← generated by reporter after test runs
	└── runs/
		└── <run-id>/
			├── <test>-trace.zip
			└── <test>-screenshot.png
```

Add to `.gitignore`:

```
<historyDir>/runs/
<historyDir>/history-index.json
```
